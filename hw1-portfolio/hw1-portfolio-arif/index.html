 <p> This is a story about Arif how he started out drawing but ended up in Advertising. </p>
  
  <p> Arif grew up in Bangladesh until he was 6 years old. He moved to California with his parents where they settled in Berkeley and his father attended UC Berkeley. Among his many likes he spent the day playing video games and drawing.  </p>
  
  <p>From his love of drawing he went to Art School where he got an Art Degree which he hides away under his bed. He still draws everyday but now he works in Advertising in the morning.</p>
